## Strategic decision making using MYSQL
For this project, I had 5 key questions that I had to respond to. The insights would help the stakeholders to:

# Understand Revenue Drivers:
*Identify the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.* This would enable the stakeholders to focus marketing efforts, optimize inventory levels, and explore bundling opportunities for these profitable products.

# Cater to Regional Demand:
*Highlight the top 5 highest-selling products in each region.* By showcasing regional preferences, this would assist stakeholders in developing tailored marketing strategies, allocating resources efficiently, and understanding regional demand trends.

# Track Sales Growth:
*Analyze month-over-month growth for 2022 and 2023 to assess trends.* Growth comparisons would help stakeholders analyze seasonal trends, evaluate the success of sales initiatives, and forecast future performance to adjust strategies effectively.

# Optimize Seasonal Opportunities:
*Pinpoint the months with the highest sales for each product category.* Identifying high-sales periods for each category would enable better planning for promotions, product launches, and targeted marketing during peak demand. Additionally, it would help stakeholders phase out unprofitable product categories.

# Invest in High-Growth Areas:
*Determine the sub-category with the highest profit growth between 2022 and 2023.* Pinpointing these high-growth sub-categories would guide stakeholders to invest strategically, replicate successful strategies, and allocate resources for sustained growth.

For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle to derive the insights and address these key questions.
